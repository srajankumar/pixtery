### Game Concept

**Color Conquest** is a multiplayer, real-time strategy game where players compete to conquer a shared grid by coloring as many tiles as possible. The game is fast-paced, with each player's goal being to capture and maintain the most territory on the grid by the end of the game.

### Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Grid Setup**:

   - The game board is a grid of tiles (e.g., 10x10 or larger depending on the number of players).
   - Each tile starts as neutral (gray) and can be colored by any player.

2. **Player Colors**:

   - Each player is assigned a unique color when they join the game.
   - Players control a small avatar on the grid, which can move in any direction (up, down, left, right).

3. **Coloring Tiles**:

   - As a player moves over a neutral tile, it gets colored in their assigned color.
   - If a player moves over a tile already colored by another player, the tile switches to the new player's color.

4. **Special Tiles**:

   - Randomly, some tiles might become "boost" tiles that temporarily increase a player's movement speed, allow them to color multiple tiles at once, or grant other abilities.

5. **Power-Ups**:

   - Players can collect power-ups scattered across the grid that provide temporary advantages, such as:
     - **Color Bomb**: Instantly colors a 3x3 area around the player.
     - **Freeze Opponent**: Temporarily freezes an opponent in place.
     - **Shield**: Prevents other players from changing the color of your tiles for a short duration.

6. **Game Duration**:

   - The game is time-limited (e.g., 2-3 minutes).
   - At the end of the timer, the player who controls the most tiles on the grid wins.

7. **Real-Time Multiplayer**:

   - The game uses WebSockets to handle real-time player movements and tile coloring.
   - A central server keeps track of the grid state and broadcasts updates to all players.

8. **Scoreboard**:
   - A live scoreboard shows the current rankings based on the number of tiles each player controls.
   - As tiles are captured, players' scores are updated in real-time.

### Technical Implementation

- **Server**: A Node.js server using WebSockets (e.g., `ws` library) to manage connections and game state.
- **Client**: A React (or any frontend framework) application to render the game grid and handle player interactions.
- **Communication**:
  - The server maintains the game state, broadcasting updates like player movements and tile color changes to all clients.
  - Clients send player actions (e.g., movement commands) to the server, which then validates and updates the game state.

This game combines strategy, quick reflexes, and real-time competition, making it both engaging and challenging.
